YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a real-time object detection system that works by processing static images. It divides the image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and probabilities for each grid cell, allowing it to detect multiple objects within a single image efficiently. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get started we will initialize the model via the Ultralytics python library. This will automatically download the model. Different sizes for the YOLOv8 model can be specified depending on the workload to adjust balance for accuracy versus speed. Once we initialize the model in our code, we can label the detected objects using [COCO dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#overview) class labels. The class labels dataset can be viewed [here](../artifacts/coco.yaml) where you can see the different types of objects that can be potentially identified.\n",

    "To use YOLO with a video file, we need to extract individual frames from the video and then apply the YOLO model to each frame separately. This process involves reading the video file, extracting frames at a specified frame rate, performing object detection on each frame, and then potentially reassembling the processed frames back into a video format. This approach allows us to leverage YOLO's capabilities for real-time object detection in video streams.\n",

    "YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) is a popular computer vision model known for its speed and accuracy in real-time object detection. It is designed to detect multiple objects within an image or video frame in a single pass, making it highly efficient for applications requiring quick and precise object identification. However, YOLOv8 is just one of many object detection models available. Other notable models include [Faster R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497), which provides high accuracy by using region proposal networks, and [SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325), which balances speed and accuracy by detecting objects in a single shot without requiring a region proposal stage.\n",

    "Beyond object detection, computer vision encompasses various other inferencing tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Image classification involves categorizing an entire image into a predefined class, using models like [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) and [Inception](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567). Semantic segmentation assigns a class label to each pixel in an image, enabling detailed scene understanding, with models like [U-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) and [DeepLab](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00915) excelling in this area. Instance segmentation combines object detection and semantic segmentation to identify and segment each object instance within an image, with models like [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870) being widely used for this purpose. These diverse inferencing tasks enable a broad range of applications, from medical imaging to autonomous driving.\n",
